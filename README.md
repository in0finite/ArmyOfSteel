Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B90sMQ98IYy4cztwy0BZIFLuyTTb1Q57). Currently, there is only linux version available, but I'll be adding version for windows very soon.

# Gameplay video

Note that this is a little older video. The newer version of the game is improved and has more features.

- multiplayer : **test** ; better transform updating (use photon networking ? use lerping with Transform syncing ?) ; we need a server - or use matchmaking ;

- build and publish (for linux and windows)

- camera angle

- navigation : astar asset is useless without local avoidance - maybe find some script on net which can do it ? ; should tree have a NavMeshObstacle ?

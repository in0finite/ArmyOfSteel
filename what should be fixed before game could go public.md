- multiplayer : **test** ; better transform updating (use photon networking ? use lerping with Transform syncing ?) ; we need a server - or use matchmaking ;

- worker can not get close enough to tree to gather from it (in most cases)

- navigation : astar asset is useless without local avoidance - maybe find some script on net which can do it ? ; **navmesh doesn't lag without trees (maybe a little bit)** ;

- navigate through AI stats of different AIs

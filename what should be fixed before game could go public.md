- multiplayer : **test** ; better transform updating (use photon networking ? use lerping with Transform syncing ?) ; we need a server - or use matchmaking ;

- build and publish (for linux and windows)

- navigation : astar asset is useless without local avoidance - maybe find some script on net which can do it ? ; should tree have a NavMeshObstacle ? - no

- client can't spawn some object - it's not rocket

- spectator UI is showing up on server ; some objects are not destroyed on client ; rockets don't move with gravity on clients ; projectiles dont move on client ; sync list throws exception ; trees are displaying warning when removing them ;

- switch to new version of unity - they may have fixed networking
